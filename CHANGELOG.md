# Changelog

All notable changes to UI Toolkit will be documented in this file.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Network Pulse chart panel resizing** - Chart cards now resize responsively on narrow viewports. Added `min-width: 0` on `.chart-card` and `overflow: hidden` on `.chart-container` to fix the CSS Grid min-width:auto gotcha that prevented canvas-based charts from shrinking. (#96)

### Changed
- **Documentation updated for UniFi OS requirement** - Removed all references to legacy standalone controllers from README and INSTALLATION.md. Added clear "UniFi OS required" callout, removed port 8443 examples, lifted Python 3.13 restriction, reordered auth options to lead with API key. (#97)

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch geo/category data from v2 API** - `source.region` mapped to country code (was looking for nonexistent `source.country`), `ips.category_name` mapped to category (was using `ips.ips_category` which only exists in `policies[]`). (#79)

### Changed
- **Document cloud access limitation** - Controller URL must be a local IP/hostname; `unifi.ui.com` cloud access is not supported (README.md and INSTALLATION.md).

### Removed
- **Dead v2 parser** - Removed unreachable `_parse_v2_traffic_flow()` from Threat Watch scheduler — v2 events are pre-normalized to legacy format by `_normalize_v2_event()` before reaching the scheduler.

### Dependencies
- docker/metadata-action v5 → v6 (#93)
- docker/build-push-action v6 → v7 (#94)

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Drop legacy standalone controller support** - Removed aiounifi dependency entirely. All API calls now use direct aiohttp requests to UniFi OS endpoints. **Users on standalone/self-hosted controllers (the Java-based controller software) should stay on v1.10.3.** (#92)
- **Remove Python 3.13 version block** - The aiounifi constraint was the only reason for the block; Python 3.13+ is now supported.
- **Simplify UniFi client** - Removed all `if self.is_unifi_os:` URL conditionals and legacy `else` branches from `shared/unifi_client.py`.
- **Update Dependabot config** - Removed aiounifi ignore rules and Python version pinning.

---

## [1.10.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **UAP-AC-LR model mapping** - `U7LR` model code was incorrectly mapped to "U7 LR" (a WiFi 7 product); corrected to "UAP AC LR". Added `G7LR` → "U7 LR" for the actual WiFi 7 U7 Long-Range AP. (#89)

### Added
- **AP model codes in debug info** - `/api/debug-info` now includes AP names, raw model codes, and display names; shown in Debug Info modal and Report Issue template for faster diagnosis.

---

## [1.10.2] - 2026-03-06

### Improved
- **Threat Watch test-fetch diagnostics** - Test both v2 payload formats independently, capture rejection body, total flow count, sample flow keys, and nested structure for faster remote debugging. (#85)

### Added
- **Gateway firmware in debug info** - `get_gateway_info()`, `/api/debug-info` endpoint, Debug Info modal, and Report Issue template now include gateway firmware version.

---

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Docker Swarm secrets support** - `_FILE` env var suffix reads secret values from files (e.g., `ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/key`) for orchestrators that mount secrets as files. Supported for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_USERNAME`, `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`, `DATABASE_URL`, `UNIFI_PASSWORD`, `UNIFI_API_KEY`. `_FILE` takes precedence if both forms are set. (#86)

### Fixed
- **Express in AP mode missing from Network Pulse** - `get_ap_details()` now includes `device_mode_override=mesh` check matching `get_access_points()` and `get_system_info()`. (#90)

### Changed
- **Remove UI Product Selector card** - Service shut down; info cards moved to dedicated full-width `.info-row` for balanced 3+2 layout.

### Dependencies
- actions/stale v9 → v10 (#88)

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Multi-WAN support in Network Pulse** - Per-WAN IP (click-to-reveal), throughput tabs, latency, and uptime for dual/multi-WAN setups. WAN tab selector in Current Throughput section (hidden for single-WAN). Extra WAN entries in WAN Status card and Network Health panel. (#83)

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch external links not opening** - `@click.prevent` modifier was unconditionally blocking navigation on AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and Shodan links. (#79)

---

## [1.9.21] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **UniFi Express in AP-only mode not detected as AP** - Express reports `type: "udm"` with `device_mode_override: "mesh"` when in AP mode. Now correctly skipped as gateway candidate and counted as AP in device counts and `get_access_points()`. (#71)

### Dependencies
- greenlet dependency update (#68)

---

## [1.9.20] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Threat Watch time range filter** - 24h / 7d (default) / 30d dropdown in filter bar, scopes both events table and stat cards. Added `time_range` query param to `/api/events` and `/api/events/stats` endpoints. (#75)
- **Auto-purge old threat events** - Events older than 30 days are automatically purged hourly via scheduler to keep DB size in check.

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch webhook delivery** - Scheduler was calling WiFi Stalker's `deliver_webhook` instead of `deliver_threat_webhook`, causing `custom_message` kwarg error on real alerts while test webhooks worked fine. (#77)

---

## [1.9.19] - 2026-02-22

### Improved
- **Form input accessibility** - Removed placeholder text from form inputs for accessibility — users with cognitive disabilities may confuse placeholders with filled-in fields. Replaced with visible `<small>` hint text below inputs with `aria-describedby` for screen readers. (#73)

### Added
- **Update available notification** - Dashboard header badge shows when a new version is available. New `/api/update-check` endpoint fetches latest GitHub release, compares against running version, caches for 1 hour. Badge links to GitHub release page; silently hidden if GitHub is unreachable. (#74)

### Fixed
- **Network Pulse theme default** - Was defaulting to dark mode instead of matching dashboard's light default.

---

## [1.9.18] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch getting 0 IPS events** - Use correct v2 traffic-flows payload format with server-side `policy_type: ["INTRUSION_PREVENTION"]` filtering instead of paginating all flows and filtering client-side. Pass scheduler timestamps through to v2 API (previously hardcoded to `timeRange: "24h"`). Added backward-compatible fallback for older firmware via `_v2_uses_new_payload` flag. (#63)
- **WiFi Stalker table overflow** - Long hostnames no longer push delete button off-screen. (#72)

### Added
- **`payload_format` diagnostic field** - Debug endpoint now reports which v2 payload format is in use.
- **`curl` dependency check** - `upgrade.sh` preflight now verifies `curl` is available. (#70)

---

## [1.9.17] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Wi-Fi Stalker signal strength mismatch** - Use UniFi API `signal` field instead of `rssi` for accurate dBm display that matches the UniFi console. `get_clients()` now captures both fields; scheduler and client summary prefer `signal` with `rssi` fallback. (#60)

---

## [1.9.16] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Dashboard gateway detection** - Prioritize dedicated gateways over UniFi Express devices in AP mode, preventing misidentification when both are present. (#58)
- **Network Pulse accessibility** - Bumped `--text-muted` and `--text-secondary` color contrast to meet WCAG AA requirements. (#65)

### Added
- **UX7 actual API model code** - Added `UDMA69B` as reported model code for UniFi Express 7, confirmed by community reporter. (#62)
- **Stale issues workflow** - GitHub Actions workflow to auto-mark issues stale after 7 days of inactivity and close after 7 more days.

---

## [1.9.15] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Schema repair coverage** - Expanded `_repair_schema()` to cover all 18 migration-added columns across 4 tables. Existing users upgrading were hitting missing column errors. (#64)

### Added
- **UniFi Express 7 (UX7) IDS/IPS support** - Added UX7 model code to the Threat Watch supported gateways list. (#62)
- **Debug Info modal** - Dashboard footer now has a "Debug Info" link that opens a modal with non-sensitive system info (version, deployment type, gateway) and one-click copy-to-clipboard for issue reporting.

---

## [1.9.14] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Wi-Fi Stalker radio band display** - Signal/Type column now shows the radio band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz) for each tracked device. Added `current_radio` column to TrackedDevice with Alembic migration. (#60)

---

## [1.9.13] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch column sorting** - Wired up `sort` and `sort_direction` parameters from the frontend to the backend API, enabling clickable column headers in the events table. (#61)

---

## [1.9.12] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Dynamic multi-WAN support** - Dashboard and Network Pulse now display 3+ WAN interfaces dynamically instead of being hardcoded for dual-WAN. (#59)

---

## [1.9.11] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **UniFi Express detection** - Detect Express devices by model code instead of device type for more reliable identification. (#47)
- **Legacy IPS timestamps** - Handle both seconds and milliseconds timestamp formats in legacy IPS events. (#48)
- **Security headers** - Moved security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.) from Caddy to FastAPI middleware so they apply in both local and production deployments. (#54)
- **API key auth** - Username is now optional when using API key authentication; improved config error handling. (#55)
- **setup.sh portability** - Removed bash 4+ syntax for compatibility with older systems (macOS, some NAS platforms). (#56)

### Changed
- **Dashboard layout** - Consolidated info cards into the tools grid and removed standalone System Requirements card.
- **Config modal** - Legacy auth (username/password) section is now collapsible, defaulting to the cleaner API key flow.

---

## [1.9.9] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Wi-Fi Stalker SSID tracking** - Track which SSID each device connects to. Added `current_ssid` field to device data and connection history. (#43)

### Fixed
- **Gateway Max support** - Added UXGB model code to supported gateways. (#40)
- **UXG Fiber support** - Added UXGA6AA model code to IDS/IPS supported models. (#35)
- **Legacy controller port detection** - Fixed issue where port was not correctly detected for self-hosted controllers. (#35)

---

## [1.9.7] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- **Shared UniFi session** - All three schedulers (Threat Watch, Wi-Fi Stalker, Network Pulse) now share a single persistent UniFi controller session instead of each creating a new connection every polling cycle. This reduces login attempts from 3/minute to 1 total, preventing fail2ban lockouts on username/password auth controllers. The session reconnects automatically if it goes stale and invalidates when config is saved via the web UI. (#35)

---

## [1.9.5] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Docker: python-dotenv not found on some platforms** - The multi-stage Docker build installed Python packages to user site-packages (`~/.local`), which depends on Python's `site` module resolving the correct path at runtime. On some platforms (notably Synology), this lookup failed, causing `python-dotenv` to not be found even though it was installed. Packages are now installed to `/usr/local` (system site-packages) which is always on Python's path. (#39)

---

## [1.9.4] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Legacy controller misdetected as UniFi OS** - Self-hosted controllers that return 401 (instead of 404) on `/api/auth/login` were incorrectly identified as UniFi OS, causing "invalid credentials" errors with no fallback to legacy auth. Now verifies UniFi OS by probing `/proxy/network/` before giving up. (#38)
- **Footer version display** - The `app/__init__.py` version string was never updated past 1.8.9, causing the footer on all pages to show v1.8.9 regardless of the actual running version. This led to incorrect troubleshooting advice telling users they were on an old image when they were actually up to date. (#26, #35)

---

## [1.9.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Legacy controller SSL regression** - v1.9.1 removed the `ssl_context` variable but left a reference to it in the legacy controller login path, causing a NameError that broke all legacy controller connections. (#26)
- **FastAPI deprecation warnings** - `Query(regex=...)` deprecated in favor of `Query(pattern=...)`. (#32)

---

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **SSL verification for self-signed certs** - Replaced custom `ssl.create_default_context()` with aiohttp's built-in `ssl=False` for more reliable self-signed cert handling on legacy controllers. (#26)

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **UDR7 IDS/IPS detection** - The Dream Router 7 reports model code `UDMA67A` via the API, not `UDR7`. Added the correct model code to the supported models list. (#21)
- **verify_ssl database default** - SQLAlchemy default was `True` but Pydantic default was `False`. Changed DB default to `False` since most UniFi deployments use self-signed certs. (#26)

### Added
- **U7 Pro XGS device name** - Added model code `UAPA6A4` to the friendly name map so it displays correctly in Network Pulse. (#28)
- **QNAP deployment guide** - Linked community-contributed QNAP Container Station guide in README and installation docs. (#29)

---

## [1.8.9] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Threat Watch gateway detection** - Fixed issue where a UniFi Express AP could be misidentified as the gateway, causing Threat Watch to incorrectly report "doesn't support IDS/IPS" even when a capable gateway (like UCG-Max) was present. Gateway detection now prioritizes dedicated gateways over Express devices. (#19)
- **Dark mode chart legend** - Fixed unreadable text in the Wi-Fi Stalker Dwell Time chart legend when using dark mode. Chart.js was ignoring the theme-aware color config for custom legend labels. (#18)

### Added
- **Dream Router 7 support** - Added UDR7 to the IDS/IPS supported models list for Threat Watch compatibility. (#21)

---

## [1.8.8] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Unraid template** - Added `unraid/unifi-toolkit.xml` for Unraid users to easily deploy via Community Applications or manual template import.

### Improved
- **Flexible config loading** - The app no longer requires a `.env` file if environment variables are passed directly to the container. This enables deployment on platforms like Unraid, Portainer, and Kubernetes that inject env vars natively.

---

## [1.8.7] - 2026-02-11

### Threat Watch v0.5.0

#### Added
- **Ignore List** - Filter out noise from known devices by IP address and severity level. Manage ignored IPs and severity thresholds directly from the Threat Watch UI.

---

## [1.8.6] - 2026-02-02

### Threat Watch v0.4.0

#### Fixed
- **Network 10.x support** - Fixed Threat Watch not displaying any IPS events on UniFi Network 10.x. Ubiquiti moved IPS events from the legacy `stat/ips/event` endpoint to a new v2 `traffic-flows` API. Threat Watch now tries the v2 API first and falls back to legacy for older firmware. (#10)

#### Improved
- **Debug endpoint** - The `/threats/api/events/debug/test-fetch` endpoint now tests both APIs and reports which one is working, making it easier to diagnose issues.

---

## [1.8.5] - 2025-01-12

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.4

#### Fixed
- **Device status notifications** - Fixed a bug where connection/disconnection toast notifications were not triggering because the status comparison happened after the device data was already updated.
- **Byte formatting edge case** - Fixed dead code where the `bytes === 0` check was unreachable because it was placed after a falsy check that already caught zero values.

#### Improved
- **Code cleanup** - Removed unused imports, simplified display name logic, consolidated repetitive code into loops, and modernized string concatenation to template literals.

---

## [1.8.4] - 2025-01-11

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.3

#### Improved
- **Faster device details modal** - Modal now opens instantly with cached data while live UniFi data loads in the background. Previously, clicking a device would wait for the API call to complete before showing the modal.

---

## [1.8.3] - 2025-01-10

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.2

#### Improved
- **Condensed Presence Pattern heat map** - Reduced heat map from 24 rows to 12 by aggregating data into 2-hour blocks. Cells are now shorter rectangles instead of squares, allowing the entire heat map to fit within the modal without scrolling.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2025-01-10

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.11.1

#### Fixed
- **Presence Pattern days calculation** - Fixed incorrect "days of data" display in Presence Pattern analytics. Previously showed "1 day(s)" even after 10+ days of tracking because it was incorrectly calculating from sample counts instead of the device's actual tracking start date.

---

## [1.8.0] - 2025-12-23

---

## [1.5.2] - 2025-12-05

### Wi-Fi Stalker v0.9.0

#### Fixed
- **Manufacturer display** - Now uses UniFi API's OUI data instead of limited hardcoded lookup. Manufacturer info (Samsung, Apple, etc.) now matches what's shown in UniFi dashboard. (#1)
- **Legacy controller support** - Fixed "Controller object has no attribute 'initialize'" error when connecting to non-UniFi OS controllers. Updated to use aiounifi v85 request API. (#3)
- **Block/unblock button state** - Button now properly updates after blocking/unblocking a device. (#2)

#### Improved
- **Site ID help text** - Added clarification that Site ID is the URL identifier (e.g., `default` or the ID from `/manage/site/abc123/...`), not the friendly site name.

### Dashboard

#### Improved
- **UniFi configuration modal** - Added clearer help text for Site ID field explaining the difference between site ID and site name.

---
